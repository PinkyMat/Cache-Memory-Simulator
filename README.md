# Cache-Memory-Simulator

In this project, a cache simulator for m-way set-associative caches with m=1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or totally associative caches was constructed in Verilog. The cache size can be chosen up to 64KB. The LRU cache replacement technique will be used to select the block to be replaced in the set (Least Recently Used). All the RAM in this project will be byte addressable. Cache memory is a type of high-speed memory used in computer design to reduce memory access time. Accessing memory from the hard disk is substantially slower than accessing memory
from cache memory.
